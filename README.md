Otherwise, don't hesitate to create an [issue](https://github.com/atb-as/tavla/issues/new) or send in a pull request if you found a bug or have an idea of something to improve on.

### Branches

The default branch of this project is `atb/main`, which is where the latest released version of AtB Tavla lives. The `master` branch is a copy of [entur/tavla](https://github.com/entur/tavla), and kept up to date trough an Action in [.github/workflows/repo-sync.yml](.github/workflows/repo-sync.yml). _The `master` branch should not be modified manually._

To update AtB Tavla to with changes from entur/tavla, merge the `master` branch into the branch you want to update.

## CI/CD

Two versions of Tavla are hosted trough Firebase, staging at [atb-tavla-staging-4ded2.web.app](https://atb-tavla-staging-4ded2.web.app/) and prod at [tavla.dev.mittatb.no](https://tavla.dev.mittatb.no/). These are kept up to date with the `atb/dev`, and `atb/main` branches respectively. 

The build and deploy is executed by the the [Build and Deploy - Staging](.github/workflows/build-and-deploy-staging.yml) and [Build and Deploy - Prod](.github/workflows/build-and-deploy-prod.yml) GitHub Actions on every push. The status of the latest builds can be seen in the [Actions tab](https://github.com/AtB-AS/tavla/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Build+and+Deploy%22).

More details on the firebase setup can be found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md).
